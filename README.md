A compiler for a tiny subset of C, written in Haskell. Targets a simple RISC-style assembly specified [here](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/40/docs/umasm.html).
## Disclaimer
This is not a homework assignment! This is a personal project through which I am building a tool that can be used to write code for educational purposes.
